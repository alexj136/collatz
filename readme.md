A Java Collatz graph drawing program - generates graphs of Collatz numbers ("3n + 1 problem") and draws the graphs using graphviz.

The interesting stuff is in the file `Collatz.java` above.

Requires Java 7 (JDK and JRE) and graphviz.

Run the ./run script with a single integer argument n, and a png will be output with the collatz graph including every integer up to n, plus any additional numbers generated by incorporating all numbers less than or equal to n into the graph:

    ./run 100

Alternatively run the following commands, plugging in whatever number you like to the second command:

    javac Collatz.java
    java Collatz 100 > g.dot
    dot -Tpng g.dot -o g.png

Either method generates an image file `g.png` with your graph.
