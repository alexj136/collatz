A Java Collatz graph drawing program - generates graphs of Collatz numbers ("3n + 1 problem") and draws the graphs using graphviz.

Requires a recent java implementation and graphviz.

Run the ./run script with a single integer argument n, and a png will be output with the collatz graph including every integer up to n, plus any additional numbers generated by incorporating all numbers less than or equal to n into the graph.

Try:

    ./run 100

to get started.
